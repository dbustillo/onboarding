/*
  # Fix Document Upload Permissions

  1. Changes
    - Simplify RLS policies for client_documents table
    - Fix storage bucket policies to allow admins to upload files for clients
    - Create a new admin function for document insertion that bypasses RLS

  2. Security
    - Maintains proper security boundaries
    - Ensures admins can upload documents for any client
    - Clients can still only access their own documents
