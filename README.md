## Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Database Setup

Create a new Supabase project and configure the database:

1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ API in your Supabase dashboard
3. Copy your Project URL and anon public key
4. Update the `.env.local` file with your credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

5. Run the database migration:
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

Or manually run the SQL migration file in your Supabase SQL editor.

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here

# OpenAI Configuration
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
VITE_OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_im1FzfzvyezWJY0ekuFnB0NV
```

### 3. OpenAI Assistant Setup

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create an API key in the API Keys section
3. Your assistant ID is already configured: `asst_im1FzfzvyezWJY0ekuFnB0NV`

### 4. Development Mode

The chatbot currently runs in development mode with mock responses. To enable full OpenAI integration:

1. Add your OpenAI API key to `.env.local`
2. Uncomment the real API call in `src/components/ChatWidget.tsx`
3. Comment out the mock response section

### 5. Production Deployment

For production deployment, you'll need to:

1. Set up a backend API endpoint to handle OpenAI requests (for security)
2. Configure environment variables on your hosting platform
3. Update the API endpoint in the ChatWidget component

## Database Schema

The platform uses a comprehensive database schema with 8 core tables:

- **profiles**: User accounts with role-based access (client/admin)
- **quote_submissions**: Integration with existing quote builder
- **onboarding_templates**: Workflow templates based on your task breakdown
- **client_onboarding**: Individual client onboarding instances
- **onboarding_tasks**: Detailed task management from your spreadsheet
- **google_drive_resources**: Google Drive integration for forms/documents
- **contracts**: DocuSign contract tracking and management
- **notifications**: In-app notification system

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**: Never expose OpenAI API keys in frontend code
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API calls
3. **Input Validation**: Sanitize user inputs before sending to OpenAI
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
5. **Row Level Security**: Database access controlled by user roles
6. **Authentication**: Secure user management with Supabase Auth
7. **Data Protection**: Encrypted data transmission and storage
